# Space Lander 3D

Team: Veronica Hu, Minh Anh Ton

Project Runtime: Nov. - Dec. 2023

Space Lander 3D is a simple 3D game simulating space landing. Using octree intersect, the game detects the lander's collision with a 3D terrain. The player is meant to manuever the lander into designated landing areas, earning points based on the quality of the landing (how hard they land, the accuracy of their landing, etc). Landing areas are generated randomly based on the chosen terrain and the player can swap between different terrains.
